"""Deployment-side hardening for the public Space: CORS allowlist, per-IP
rate limiting, security headers.

This lives in ``hf-space/`` on purpose. It is infrastructure for *this*
deployment, not domain logic — a Fly.io or Modal wrapper would solve the same
problems with that platform's primitives (edge WAF, per-route quotas) and
would not import this module. Keeping it out of ``mcp-core`` is what makes the
cloud-agnostic promise real rather than nominal.

Everything is configurable by environment variable so the dev Space and prod
Space can diverge without a code change.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- CORS

# No allowlist here, and that is a deliberate, measured decision — not an
# oversight. Do not "fix" this by reinstating one without re-running the
# checks below.
#
# An allowlist was implemented and shipped to the dev Space, then found to be
# inert: Hugging Face's edge proxy answers CORS preflights itself and rewrites
# the CORS headers on every response, so nothing the application decides ever
# reaches the browser. Measured on the deployed Space:
#
#   OPTIONS /api/v1/passage
#     Origin: https://evil.example.com          -> 200 + acao: evil.example.com
#     Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE     -> allow-methods: DELETE
#
# DELETE is not in this app's allowed methods, and Starlette answers a
# disallowed preflight with 400 (verified locally against this exact code).
# Getting a 200 that echoes DELETE proves the request never reached us. The
# edge also stamps `access-control-expose-headers: *` on plain 404s, a header
# this app never sets.
#
# Keeping a restrictive list would have been worse than having none: it reads
# as an active control in code review and in the threat model, while providing
# zero protection in production. False assurance is the real hazard.
#
# The protection that *does* hold on this platform is the rate limiter below,
# which lives in the container and is out of the edge's reach.
#
# IF THIS EVER MOVES OFF HUGGING FACE (Fly, Modal, VPS): re-add an allowlist.
# Application-level CORS is effective everywhere the edge does not pre-empt
# it. The origins to use are ohmywind.fr and www/dev variants, plus the
# openwind.fr family which is kept as a 301 source (a browser that followed
# the redirect still sends the original origin on the subsequent XHR), plus
# http://localhost:5173 and :4173 for `vite dev` / `vite preview`.
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["*"]


# ----------------------------------------------------------------- client IP

# uvicorn runs with ``forwarded_allow_ips="*"`` (required: HF terminates TLS at
# the edge, and without it every redirect and scheme is wrong). In that mode
# uvicorn's ProxyHeadersMiddleware trusts every hop and takes the *leftmost*
# X-Forwarded-For entry — which is whatever the client chose to send. So
# ``request.client.host`` is attacker-controlled and unusable as a rate-limit
# key: `curl -H 'X-Forwarded-For: <random>'` would mint a fresh bucket per
# request.
#
# The only entry we can trust is the one appended by the proxy directly in
# front of us, i.e. the rightmost. ``OPENWIND_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`` says how
# many proxies sit in front of the app; raise it if another CDN is ever
# stacked ahead of HF (each extra hop shifts the real client one place left).
TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS = max(1, int(os.environ.get("OPENWIND_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS", "1")))

# Counting from the right is only safe while the chain length is what we think
# it is. The Cloudflare Worker in ``packages/edge-proxy`` rewrites
# X-Forwarded-For to the address Cloudflare vouches for, which is what pins
# TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS to 2 in production.
#
# But the Space stays directly reachable on its ``*.hf.space`` hostname, and
# that path bypasses the Worker's sanitising. With hops=2 and a hand-written
# ``X-Forwarded-For``, the chain becomes ``<forged>, <real>`` and the app reads
# the forged entry — a fresh rate-limit bucket per request, measured live on
# 2026-08-01.
#
# So the hop count is not a property of the deployment, it is a property of
# each request: only traffic carrying the shared secret the Worker injects has
# earned the extra hop. Everything else is treated as direct, where the
# rightmost entry is the one HF appended and cannot be forged.
